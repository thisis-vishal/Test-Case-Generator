# Test-Case-Generator
This project can help one to create random test case for DSA coding problems which contains data structure like: Array s, strings, trees, numbers,  headp, binary tree, BST etc

How I create the test cases for the problem 

First clone my project from 
https://github.com/thisis-vishal/Test-Case-Generator

Procedure to install it in local machine

Make sure you have python, pip, virtual environment installed in your machine
Run the predefined venv in your machine accordingly and install dependency from the requirements.txt file if any missing


After that you can move to parent directory of tc_gen.py file to create your test cases

Steps involved are:

First define the number of test case according to your choice
Choose the block of code you require comment the remaining type of test cases creation block 
Then use module already created to define the constraints of the input value print them at the place according to your problem statement 

Make changes and create new algorithms according to the pre described format 


Run the tc_gen file this will generate the test case which you will found in input folder 

You can use them to add test cases to you problem 

I have create a structure to create test cases of following types:

Arrays
Strings
Matrix
Square Matrix
Tree
Binary Tree
Binary Search Tree
Linked List
Graph ( Adjacency Matrix)
Heap


You can contribute by adding you code by not changing the previous code
